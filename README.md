- Feature engineering was carried out, creating a new table that calculates the customer lifetime value (CLTV) for each customer, and uploading it to a local database

Python: Jupyter Notebooks
- Extracted data from SQLite database using the sqlite3 library
- Explored the use of XGBoost regression models to determine factors that correlate the most to the customer lifetime value
